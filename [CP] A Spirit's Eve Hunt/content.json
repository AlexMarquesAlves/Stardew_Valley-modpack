		        "Spirit1a": "Greetings O @,^^ On this the day Spirit's Eve, a special hunt of sorts awaits thee. As you see, my darling little friends have left gifts all across the valley in their excitement for tonight's festivities. Treasures from the deepest depths of Skull Cavern. Riches found in the rarest of ores. All scattered, awaiting anyone to find them. ^^ I welcome thee to partake in the merriment of the day and seek out what you will. Enjoy today to its fullest, whether that mean scavenging or no. ^^ Lastly, as thanks for playing along with my dear apple friends, here's a riddle I pose for thee. ^^ 'I am a body with a leg, an arm and a head, but I look like I am naked and bare. What am I?' A special surprise awaits thee in the morrow. ^^ -- Nix, Enigma of Spirit's Eve",
		        "Spirit1b": "Greetings Once More O @,^^ How did thee fair in the hunt? Did thou scour the land for the secret treasures my friends scattered about before enjoying the night's festivities? Or did thee partake in some other activity instead? No matter what thou chose, I wish thee had a mystical and wonderous Spirit's Eve regardless. ^^ Though, I must bid thee forgive me. For it seems you may have encountered creatures during thy hunt as a result of my negligence. ^^ Had I known Lux wished to participate in the merriment as well, I would have sought her hand. We have talked much about this incident since. And I do believe you have nothing to fear in the coming years. ^^ Oh, and to that riddle I posed to thee, an answer I shall give: What am I? Why, I am a Skeleton, of course. Come from the depths of the mines to enjoy the merriment of this day. ^^ Until the coming year, I bid thee adieu. ^^ -- Nix, Enigma of Spirit's Eve %item object 499 5 %%",
		        "Spirit1alux": "To Whom It May Concern, ^^ I know not how one such as yourself enticed Nix to invite you to their Spirit's Eve festivities. Nor do I know your connection with the apple creatures they seem to hold so dear. But. If someone like you were deigned worthy  to partake in the fun and not I? Well, that just does not do, now does it? ^^ Enjoy Nix's hunt to your fullest. But be wary while scouring the valley. For I invited a few guests of my own to enjoy Spirit's Eve alongside you. From the darkest of mines and the most treacherous of caverns, they will rise. ^^ Best bring a sword. ^^ -- Lux, Paradox of Spirit's Eve",
		        "Spirit1blux": "Apologies @, ^^ I know that I did not make the greatest of impressions upon you. And instead of furthering the joy of Spirit's Eve, my actions only made it worse for you. After a long tête-à-tête with Nix, I have come to realize the difficulty I must have put upon you. ^^ For that, I do apologize. ^^ In my sullenness about not getting to be with Nix for this holiday, I punished you unjustly. Which was unforgiveable, I know. ^^ Still, I do hope, one day, you can find it in your heart to forgive me. In the coming years, I wish you nothing but the most wondrous of Spirit's Eves. Whether that mean partaking in Nix's hunt or not. ^^ -- Lux, Paradox of Spirit's Eve",

		        "Spirit2alux": "To @, ^^ Apologies for sending you another letter, though it seemed my previous one would be my last. But I must warn you of something most unfortuitous. ^^ You see, as a result of my summoning last year, the creatures I bid forth have appeared to have aquired a taste for the surface world. Especially on days such as Spirit's Eve. ^^ As such, despite Nix and my pleas to them to celebrate with us, some still seem determined to surface. Though, I will not have you suffer again due to me. ^^ With help, I managed to cast a charm on those that choose leave for your world. Although not enough to stop them, it will be enough to weaken them significantly should you run into them. ^^ I wish you nothing but good fortune today, @. ^^ -- Lux, Paradox of Spirit's Eve",
